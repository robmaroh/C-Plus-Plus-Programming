# CS-210 System Analysis and Design
Repository for my class work in C++

# Description of programs
I have created an app called Calculator that allows the user to perform simple calculations, such as add, subtract, multiply and divide.
I have also created an app called Chada that creates a 12 hour / 24 hour clock that the user can update by hour, minute and second.
I have created an app called TemperatureFarenheit that reads a text file of City locations and average temperatures and converts them to Farenheit temperatures.
I have also created an app called Source that is tied to PythonCode.py that combines functions from Python with a main in C++ that allows the user to create a multiplication table or double a number.

# What did I do particularly well?
I would say that, at first, I struggled with creating even the simple apps, and it shows in my coding. As I worked with C++ over time, I developed better coding, such as following naming conventions and commenting, and developing programs with more efficient code. 

# Where could I enhance my code, to make it more efficient, secure, etc?
I believe that as I get better at creating and linking to functions, I could make my code more modular and easier to update / change. This would also have the effect of making it more efficient.

# Did I find any piece of code more challenging and how did I overcome this? What tools/resources am I adding to my network?
The code I find most challenging is classes and ensuring that the code I write follows what I set in my class.
I found many resources that I will be adding to my network, such as Github, and Stack Overflow. They have so many questions and answers available to someone learning code! I realized that someone has already had the same problem that I have had, and there is an answer for it on one of these two sites.

# What skills have I learned that will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The most important skill, I would say, would be learning to use Microsoft Visual Studio. I was a complete novice at Visual Studio when I started this class, and now I feel (somewhat) confident in my skills. Also, I have learned many ways to start projects and problem solving that will be useful in the future.
